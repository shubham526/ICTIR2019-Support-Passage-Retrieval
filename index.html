				For my first post, I want to begin with a very basic supervised learning machine learning algorithm that we all learn when we first learn supervised learning---Logistic Regression. We are going to 					look at what logistic regression is, how it works (behind the scenes!) and implement a basic logistic regression model in Python. I assume that you know how to take derivatives of simple functions 					(nothing fancy, I promise) and can follow basic high school algebra. So lets begin!
			</p>

			<h2 class="section-heading" id = "supervised learning">1. What is Supervised Learning?</h2>
			<p>
				Imagine a teacher teaching a class. The teacher gives a lecture, then gives some homework to reinforce the concepts. The students work on the homework, the teacher then provides feedback and points 					out mistakes in the students' work. The students go back to correct their mistakes and improve on their answers from the previous attempt. This entire process results in the students learning the 					conept better so that in the future they do not make the same mistakes. In essence, the students take advantage of the vast knowledge possessed by their teacher to learn from their mistakes and 					improve. At the end, there is a final exam where the teacher evaluates the students on how much they learnt by presenting them with different (but conceptually similar) questions. And that's what 					supervised learning is all about! There is always someone to supervise us as we learn and helps us to correct our mistakes to improve on our knowledge.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In machine learning, we are basically doing the same to a machine. We assume the role of the teacher (technically the data is the teacher, but...well, you get what I mean!) and the computer is our 					student! We want to teach the computer some new concepts (about the data). To do this, we present the computer with some data and ask it work on it. The computer learns something and comes back to 					us and we evaluate its work (using some metrics). We then point out mistakes and ask the computer to re-do the work (the learning process) until it gets everything perfect (or near perfect, nothing 					is perfect in this world!). The data we present to the computer as "assignments" is called <i><b>training data</b></i> in machine learning lingo. We basically "train" the computer using this data. 					But for the final exam, it doesn't make sense to test our student on questions he/she(it!) has already seen, right? So to evaluate what the computer learnt and whether it can apply the concepts to
				some similar yet unseen questions, we test it using a separate portion of the data, which we call <i><b>test data</b></i> in machine learning.
			</p>

			<p>	
				However, remember how the questions on your exams were similar to the ones you had seen on the assignment? They are similar, but little different, testing whether you actually learnt the concept (or 					just copied from your friend!). Your teacher doesn't test you with completely unseen new information (I am sure!). Similarly, training our computer on certain data and testing it on another would be 					completely unfair (How dare you!). Both the train and the test data must come from the same place (or the same <i>distribution</i>). Otherwise testing the student makes no sense! Hence, before we do 					anything else, a common practice is to divide the data we have into two sets: the train and the test sets. While training our machine, we provide it with the training data and then evaluate it on 					the test set. This form of "teaching" out computer is called <i>Supervised Learning</i> in machine learning lingo. This is opposite to <i>Unsupervised Learning</i> where there is no teacher and you 
				are on your own to figure out your mistakes. But we are not going to discuss unsupervised learning here (atleast for now). If you are interested (like, RIGHT NOW) then you can read about the 					differences between supervised and unsupervised learning on a Medium post <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning-14f68e32ea8d">here</a>. 
			</p>
	
			<p> Now that we know what supervised learning means, let's take a look at a popular supervised learning method: Logistic Regression</p>
